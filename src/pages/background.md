Album is a tool for unifying computational tools across frameworks,
languages, and environments. Although Album is an extension of a
prototype originally developed by [Kyle
Harrington](https://kyleharrington.com) while at the University of
Idaho, the pioneering development has been performed at the Max
Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) by Kyle Harrington, Jan
Philipp Albrecht, and Deborah Schmidt. Many of the design principles
were revised and conceived by Deborah Schmidt, while Jan Philipp
Albrecht established the technical foundation of Album.

The work at MDC was supported by [Helmholtz
Imaging](https://www.helmholtz-imaging.de), which is a
platform of the Helmholtz Association to bring scientists and
engineers in the Helmholtz Association together to promote and develop
imaging science and to foster synergies across imaging modalities and
applications within the Helmholtz Association.
