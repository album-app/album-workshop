`album` is a decentralized distribution platform for solutions to specific scientific problems. 
It works across platforms, tools, and data domains and is designed to address limitations in reproducibility of 
scientific data software solutions and workflows, particularly when interactivity is needed. `album` can be used to 
programmatically define how to interoperate between applications. It can ship versatile applications while tweaking 
them for a specific target audience or use case.
