<p>The privacy of my visitors is extremely important. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I will never share your email address or any other personal information to anyone without your direct consent.</p>

<p>I. Definitions</p>

<p>The privacy policy of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine is based on the terms used by the European legislator in the adoption of the Basic Regulation on Data Protection (DSGVO). Our data protection declaration should be easy to read and understand both for the public and for our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to explain the terms used in advance.</p>

<p>In this privacy policy we use the following terms, among others:</p>

<p>personal data<br />
  Personal data is all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as “data subject”). Identifiable is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by assignment to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more special characteristics that express the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.<br />
person affected<br />
      Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data are processed by the controller.<br />
Processing<br />
      Processing means any operation or series of operations carried out with or without the aid of automated procedures relating to personal data, such as the collection, collection, organization, filing, storage, adaptation or modification, retrieval, querying, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or any other form of provision, reconciliation or linking, restriction, deletion or destruction.<br />
Restricting processing<br />
      Restriction on processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of restricting their future processing.<br />
Pseudonymization<br />
      Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be assigned to a specific data subject without additional information, provided that this additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures that ensure that the personal data is not assigned to an identified or identifiable natural person.<br />
person in charge or person responsible for processing<br />
      The controller or controller shall be the natural or legal person, authority, body, office or other body which alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data. Where the purposes and means of such processing are laid down by Union law or by the law of the Member States, the controller or the specific criteria for his appointment may be laid down in accordance with Union law or the law of the Member States.<br />
Order processor<br />
      Processor is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller.<br />
receiver<br />
      The recipient is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other body to which personal data is disclosed, whether or not it is a third party. However, authorities which may receive personal data under Union law or the law of the Member States within the framework of a particular investigation mandate shall not be regarded as recipients.<br />
Thirds<br />
      Third party is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other body other than the data subject, the data processor, the data processor and the persons authorised to process the personal data under the direct responsibility of the data processor or the data processor.<br />
agreement<br />
      Acceptance is any informed and unequivocal statement of intent, in the form of a statement or other clear affirmative act, voluntarily given by the data subject for the particular case, that the data subject indicates his or her consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her.</p>

<p>IV. General information about data processing</p>

<p>scope of processing of personal data</p>

<p>We only process personal data of our users if this is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our contents and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place regularly only after consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for real reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.
Legal basis for the processing of personal data</p>

<p>Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Article 6(1)(a) of the EU Data Protection Ordinance (DSGVO) serves as the legal basis.</p>

<p>For the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.</p>

<p>To the extent that processing of personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Article 6(1)(c) DSGVO serves as the legal basis.</p>

<p>In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Article 6(1)(d) DSBER serves as the legal basis.</p>

<p>If processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the former interest, Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO serves as the legal basis for processing.</p>

<p>3 – data erasure and storage time</p>

<p>The personal data of the person concerned will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the person responsible is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.</p>

<p>V. Provision of the website and creation of log files</p>

<p>1 – description and scope of data processing</p>

<p>Every time you visit our website, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the calling computer.</p>

Types of browser
Internet Service Provider (ISP)
Date and time stamp
Referring and exit pages
Number of clicks
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The data is also stored in the log files of our system. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.</p>

<p>2 – legal basis for data processing</p>

<p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para.1 lit. f DSGVO.</p>

<p>3 – purpose of data processing</p>

<p>The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the website to be delivered to the user’s computer. For this the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.</p>

<p>The data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data serves us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>

<p>In these purposes is also our legitimate interest in data processing according to Art. 6 para.1 lit. f DSGVO.</p>

<p>4 – storage time</p>

<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary to achieve the purpose of its collection. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.</p>

<p>The controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the time necessary to achieve the data retention purpose or as provided for by the European regulator or other legislator in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject.</p>

<p>If the storage purpose is not fulfilled or if a storage period prescribed by the European Directive and Regulation Giver or another competent legislator expires, the personal data will be blocked or deleted routinely and in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>

<p>5 – possibility of objection and elimination</p>

<p>The collection of data to provide the website and the storage of data in log files is mandatory for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user.</p>

<p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO.</p>

<p>3 – purpose of data processing</p>

<p>The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to simplify the use of websites for users. Some functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For this it is necessary that the browser is recognized even after a page change.</p>

<p>If you have exercised your right of rectification, deletion or limitation of processing against the controller, the controller is obliged to notify all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of such rectification or deletion or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.</p>
